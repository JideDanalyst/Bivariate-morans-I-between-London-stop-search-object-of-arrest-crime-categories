<h1>- A bivariate Morans I of London stop & search (Onbject of arrest) & crime categories</h1>

<h1>-Analysis Description
<h2></h2>
The purpose of this analysis is to conduct a bivariate Moran's I on London stop and search data, specifically examining the object of arrest categories and crime categories. This will identify and quantify the spatial autocorrelation between these two variables. The analysis aims to understand the spatial relationships and clustering patterns between the types of objects involved in arrests during stop and search operations and the different crime categories across London areas. By revealing whether areas with high incidences of certain crime categories also exhibit high incidences of specific object of arrest categories, the study provides insights into potential spatial dependencies. These insights can then be used to inform and enhance targeted and effective policing strategies.<br />
